1	Auto-grader:
1.1	Solution:
Hope for the best Prepare for the worst.
2	Syntax:
2.1	Different in different programming language:
Common mistakes like after defining a function in python we use colon and in c++ we use semicolon after every statement. I put semicolon after defining function in python.
3	Typing Error:
3.1	Solution:
Code was not giving correct answer so I debug using print”a” command after every single line. I was writing else statement outside the function.

4	Recursion:
4.1	Solution:
Concept not clear about recursion. I just know that recursion is a process in which a function call itself. But can’t use recursion as loop.
5	Attribute Error:
5.1	Solution:
Error in module of a library. For example form math import py file it will give Attribute Error.
6	Logical Error:
6.1	Solution
The error which the complier can’t understand. It is bug in program that cause it to operate incorrectly.
